    "Deadlocks:\n",
    "A deadlock is a situation that occurs in a multithreaded or multiprocess environment where two or more threads or processes are unable to proceed because they are each waiting for a resource that the other holds. In other words, it's a scenario where threads are stuck in a circular wait, preventing any of them from making progress. Deadlocks can lead to a complete halt of the program or system, requiring external intervention to resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider two threads, Thread A and Thread B, where Thread A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2, while Thread B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1. This creates a deadlock situation because neither thread can proceed without the resource that the other holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Conditions:\n",
    "A race condition is a situation that occurs when two or more threads (or processes) access shared data or resources concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the order in which the threads are scheduled to run. The result of a race condition can be unpredictable and lead to incorrect behavior or data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a scenario where two threads, Thread X and Thread Y, are updating a shared variable simultaneously. If the update operation is not properly synchronized, the final value of the variable can depend on the timing of the threads, leading to unexpected results."
